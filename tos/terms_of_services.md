# GitToken Terms of Service
Effective Date: 8/7/2017, 3:57:00 PM

## Thank You for using GitToken software!

GitToken ("GTK") uses GitToken products and services ("Services"). These Services are provided as open-source software by contributors at the GitHub organization Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") https://github.com/git-token.

In addition to these Terms of Service ("ToS"), there may be other GitToken Services with specific ToS. Those ToS extend to this ToS agreement, and this ToS agreement extends to those specific ToS between GitToken and you when you use those Services.

GitToken provides these Services in hopes that they will enable organizations to better incentivize and reward contributors, automatically manage Ethereum token distributions, and provide new access to funding for software development.
By using GitToken Services you are agreeing to these terms.

Please read the following ToS carefully before using any GitToken service.

Versions of this ToS can be found [here](https://github.com/git-token/documentation/tree/master/tos).

## Use of GitToken Services

All organizations using GitToken Services retain intellectual property rights over their software. GitToken provides software that enables organizations to issue nominal amounts of Ethereum tokens in exchange for contributions in organizations' GitHub repositories.

GitToken also provides automated token offerings that correspond to GitHub contribution events, such as a milestone being reached. These offerings may only take place on GitToken provided user interfaces. The purpose of GitToken is to provide an alternative funding mechanism to software development groups.

GitToken provides these Services in the hopes that users who benefit from the software provided by the organization will fund the software's continued development.
GitToken does not restrict issued tokens from being interchanged using third party contracts and services. GitToken does not restrict the organization using the software from ascribing additional properties to the token.

Any additional features added or integrated into the organization's software that may alter the characteristics of the token are completed at the sole discretion and liability of the organization. GitToken, and its contributors, will not be held accountable for any claim, damage, implied warranties, or fine for any token resembling a financial security for any reason.

GitToken asserts tokens issued using GitToken Services are not financial securities. Tokens are issued to GitHub users when contributions are made toward an organizations' GitHub repositories. Any benefit flowing to the contributor or organization is done so in the direct renumeration of tokens given to the contributor in exchange for work rendered.

In the event that GitToken receives notice pertaining to the determination of GitToken issued tokens resembling financial securities from financial regulation authorities (e.g. Securities & Exchange Commission), GitToken contributors will determine next steps, including potentially ceasing access to parties in affected jurisdictions and applying for exemption where its reasonable to continue operations.

GitToken is obligated to comply and aid in the enforcement of all applicable laws. In the event that law enforcement requests help in investigating illegal activity, GitToken will support such investigations.
