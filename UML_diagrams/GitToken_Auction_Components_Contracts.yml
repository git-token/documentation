[ <contractethereum> Auction Contract (Ethereum) | Purpose(s) |
    - Lock initial Ether for bidding (think of it as a credit account, of sorts). Essentially this is your maximum bid: 1 Token == total amount in credit.
    However, in practice this should represent a maximum offer, whereby the quantity X price is specified in the offer. (e.g. 10,000 tokens == total amount)
