# Token Auctioneering

Ethereum ERC20 tokens have recently provided a new mechanism for funding projects. While tokens have brought liquidity to start-ups, it has also brought mis-pricing and speculation.

Many of the projects that have offered tokens to build their projects have used Git and GitHub to manage and develop software collaboratively, yet independently.

There is a clear relationship between the number of git contributions a project has and the market capitalization of the project.
