Initial Coin Offerings, ICOs, token, commodity, security, or paid API key offerings, really whatever you want to call them, have become a massive global phenomenon. According to many in the blockchain community we are at peak ICO, with plenty of projects raising over 7 figures for little more than a whitepaper and over $1.8 billion in total funds raised. However, amidst the chaos, there are some teams are keeping focused and designing protocols that will fundamentally transform how value is generated, tracked, and transferred in the 21st century.

So how can we make sure that the teams being funded amidst the ICO hype are those building the future and not those building their bank accounts? To get started let's look at how the current process works.

## The Process for Evaluating ICOs Today

The ecosystem around ICOs has evolved significantly over the past two years, with an ever increasing list of ICO news and research outlets emerging. But at its core the process for evaluating ICOs involves looking at the same three metrics any early-stage investor looks at: team, product, and market

### Team

>I don’t know what a business is. All a company is is a bunch of people together to create a product or service. There’s no such thing as a business, just pursuit of a goal—a group of people pursuing a goal.
~Elon Musk

Team is the only metric that can be directly assessed at any stage of a company’s life. It’s hard to know much about a product that hasn’t been built or a market that hasn’t been explored, but before there’s anything there’s a team. In some cases VCs will almost entirely ignore product and market on the assumption that a good team with neither will solve the problem while a bad team with both will squander the opportunity.

The importance of teams isn’t to say that founders need to be a group of MIT graduates with 10 years or more of experience in the domain they’re exploring because [even they can forget to change their passwords](https://www.wired.com/story/enigma-ico-ethereum-heist/). However, a good team should always display passion, integrity, and adaptability. Most of these are tired and often nebulous concepts, but they define what you’ll hear from almost any established early-stage VC and (consequently) what you’ll read in almost any ICO report today.

### Product

>This is a quote.
>~Me


If we agree with Elon’s description above we agree that every company starts with a team and an idea or goal, but they don’t always (or often) start with a product. Of course, as any bad motivational poster will tell you, building a product is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. And as anyone who’s managed a project before knows, there’s a long road between starting a project and actually building out its core features. As might be expected that road starts with planning out what those core features are, breaking them down into manageable milestones, prioritizing, and planning resources accordingly.

Naturally then, the first step in evaluating a product is to ask the question: does the team have a product? If they do, great, you can evaluate the product on its merits. If they don’t, the question really comes back to whether or not the team has a clearly defined vision and the ability to execute on that vision. In the ICO world determining this is still done in a relatively information fashion, through reading whitepapers and talking with founders.

### Market

>In a great market — a market with lots of real potential customers — the market pulls product out of the startup.
~Marc Andreesen

While every company has to have a team, and is at working on building or selling something that at least vaguely resembles a product or service, not every company has to have a market. In fact, plenty of companies throughout history haven’t had any market at all Those companies don’t exist anymore.

The fundamental importance of market in the discussion of product-market fit has led some like Andy Rachleff, formerly of Benchmark Capital, to the conclusion that market is actually the most important thing to look for in a startup. ‘Rachleff’s Law’ (like many VCs Andy was known for his humility) as he calls it is as follows:

- When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins.
- When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins.
- When a great team meets a great market, something special happens.

This is why investors like to talk about funnels. How big is the market? How will you acquire users? What will keep those users coming back? Did my assistant make that reservation for Dorsia like I asked him to?

### Crypto-Specific Considerations

While there is a lot of similarity between contributing to early stage projects and contributing to token-based projects, there are still some key differences. The most glaring of these differences is the introduction of tokens. The presence of tokens introduces a few different questions.

**1) What does the token do?**

This might be hard for some to hear but not everything needs to be a token. However, with the current hype around ICOs everything is becoming one. Understanding what a token does and why those functions can’t be managed by an existing token (most often ETH given that most ICOs are ERC20 tokens) is critical.

**2) What are the token economics?**

## What’s Missing

So from the above it sounds like we have at least some idea of how to evaluate token-based projects. But we still haven't answered our initial question: How can we stop scammers (intentional or not) from using ICOs to fill their bank accounts? Or more accurately, how is it that scammers are able to use ICOs to fill their bank accounts?

The simplest argument is that although we understand as a community how to do our due dilligence on projects (this isn't the first post to discuss how to evaluate ICOs and certainly not the first to discuss how to evaluate early-stage projects) we simply don't do it. It's easy in this case to pass the buck and say that, even if some investors aren't particularly bright, the market is working as intended.

But as we see it taking this approach is not only dangerous, it is an existential risk to the blockchain ecosystem, from both an economic and regulatory perspective. This is in part because of just how liquid capital is in the blockchain ecosystem.

In the traditional venture capital world the lack of liquidity around shares makes it difficult for founders to make a quick exit even if they’re as sexy as and getting as much serious traction through click farms as Pied Piper. But in the blockchain world tokens are instantly liquid upon generation, so when a project is ‘hot’ it can reap the rewards of that traction instantly.

While that liquidity - the kind that comes from an instantly accessible global marketplace - is kind of a core point of blockchains, it also creates perverse incentives. It’s no wonder then that in [his article earlier this summer](https://medium.com/@wmougayar/10-things-i-dont-like-about-icos-5c84c19875eb) many of William Mougayar’s concerns about ICOs centered around precisely this problem. Put broadly, if you raise 7 figures for a project and give it to people up front, they tend to slow down or even stop working. This is why your salary isn't paid the first day you go to work and why [studies have shown](https://www.fastcompany.com/3057027/the-case-against-startups-raising-as-much-money-as-humanly-possible) raising too much money too quickly makes it more likely for companies to fail. Generally the sweet spot for funding maxes out at 18 months. Enough time to breath for 6 months, work diligently for 6 months, and sweat for 6 months.

Proof of code: Using GitToken to Tie Cash to Contributions

GitToken allows any project to show its commitment to code by tying its fundraising to specific GitHub events and milestones. Contributors on the other hand can be assured that their donations are being put directly towards tangible roadmap items without any middleman allocating the funds.
