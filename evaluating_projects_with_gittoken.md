Initial Coin Offerings, ICOs, token, commodity, security, or paid API key offerings, really whatever you want to call them, have become a massive global phenomenon. According to many in the blockchain community we are at peak ICO, with plenty of projects raising over 7 figures for little more than a whitepaper and over $1.8 billion in total funds raised. However, amidst the chaos, there are some teams are keeping focused and designing protocols that will fundamentally transform how value is generated, tracked, and transferred in the 21st century.

So how can we make sure that the teams being funded amidst the ICO hype are those building the future and not those building their bank accounts? Let's explore a few options.

## Conducting Proper Due Diligence on ICOs

The ecosystem around ICOs has evolved significantly over the past two years, with an ever increasing list of ICO news and research outlets emerging. But at its core the process for evaluating ICOs involves looking at the same three metrics any early-stage investor looks at: team, product, and market.

### Team

>I don’t know what a business is. All a company is is a bunch of people together to create a product or service. There’s no such thing as a business, just pursuit of a goal—a group of people pursuing a goal.
~Elon Musk

Team is the only metric that can be directly assessed at any stage of a company’s life. It’s hard to know much about a product that hasn’t been built or a market that hasn’t been explored, but before there’s anything there’s a team. In some cases VCs will almost entirely ignore product and market on the assumption that a good team with neither will solve the problem while a bad team with both will squander the opportunity.

The importance of teams isn’t to say that founders need to be a group of MIT graduates with 10 years or more of experience in the domain they’re exploring because [even they can forget to change their passwords](https://www.wired.com/story/enigma-ico-ethereum-heist/). However, a good team should always display passion, integrity, and adaptability. Most of these are tired and often nebulous concepts, but they define what you’ll hear from almost any established early-stage VC and (consequently) what you’ll read in almost any ICO report today.

### Product

>This is a quote.
>~Me


If we agree with Elon’s description above we agree that every company starts with a team and an idea or goal, but they don’t always (or often) start with a product. Of course, as any bad motivational poster will tell you, building a product is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. And as anyone who’s managed a project before knows, there’s a long road between starting a project and actually building out its core features. As might be expected that road starts with planning out what those core features are, breaking them down into manageable milestones, prioritizing, and planning resources accordingly.

Naturally then, the first step in evaluating a product is to ask the question: does the team have a product? If they do, great, you can evaluate the product on its merits. If they don’t, the question really comes back to whether or not the team has a clearly defined vision and the ability to execute on that vision. In the ICO world determining this is still done in a relatively information fashion, through reading whitepapers and talking with founders.

### Market

>In a great market — a market with lots of real potential customers — the market pulls product out of the startup.
~Marc Andreesen

While every company has to have a team, and is at working on building or selling something that at least vaguely resembles a product or service, not every company has to have a market. In fact, plenty of companies throughout history haven’t had any market at all Those companies don’t exist anymore.

The fundamental importance of market in the discussion of product-market fit has led some like Andy Rachleff, formerly of Benchmark Capital, to the conclusion that market is actually the most important thing to look for in a startup. ‘Rachleff’s Law’ (like many VCs Andy was known for his humility) as he calls it is as follows:

- When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins.
- When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins.
- When a great team meets a great market, something special happens.

In Marc Andreesen's terms above, markets can drive even a mediocre team to make great products - products that meet the customer's needs. Incidentally, this is why investors like to talk about funnels. How big is the market? How will you acquire users? What will keep those users coming back? Did my assistant make that reservation for Dorsia like I asked him to?

### Crypto-Specific Considerations

While there is a lot of similarity between contributing to early stage projects and contributing to token-based projects, there are still some key differences. The most glaring of these differences is the introduction of tokens. The presence of tokens introduces a few different questions.

**1) What does the token do?**

This might be hard for some to hear but not everything needs to be a token. However, with the current hype around ICOs everything is becoming one. Understanding what a token does and why those functions can’t be managed by an existing token (most often ETH given that most ICOs are ERC20 tokens) is critical.

**2) What are the token economics?**

## What’s Missing

Although anyone could read through the above, or read through one of the many other posts outlining some of the basic things to look at in evaluating an early-stage project we don't believe it's smart or necessarily fair to assume everyone will conduct their own due diligence.

While it might sound satisfying to some to say that, even if scams are occurring, the market is working as intended we view this as fundamentally misguided. Not only is the current system incredibly inefficient from a capital allocation perspective, it poses an existential reputational risk to any blockchain that allows for interoperable token ecosystems.

In the traditional venture capital world the lack of liquidity around shares makes it difficult for founders to make a quick exit even if they’re as sexy as and getting as much serious traction as Pied Piper. But in the blockchain world where tokens are instantly liquid the idea of an instant payday can actually distract from building the underlying protocol or application. In fact, it's well known that [companies that raise too much money too quickly fail](https://www.fastcompany.com/3057027/the-case-against-startups-raising-as-much-money-as-humanly-possible) more often. The promise of an instant payday also creates other perverse incentives, some of which William Mougayar outlined in [a post on ICOs earlier this summer](https://medium.com/@wmougayar/10-things-i-dont-like-about-icos-5c84c19875eb).

Fundamentally, we need a way outside of founder promises to ensure that vesting schedules occur on the basis of tangible milestones attached to real work. And we believe that the real work involved in building protocols and applications is in writing code. This is a problem we think GitToken can help solve.

## Proof of code: Using GitToken to Tie Cash to Contributions

GitToken allows any project to show its commitment to code by tying its fundraising to specific GitHub events and milestones. Contributors on the other hand can be assured that their donations are being put directly towards tangible roadmap items without any middleman allocating the funds.
