According to many in the blockchain community we are at peak ICO, with plenty of projects raising over 7 figures for little more than a whitepaper and over $1.8 billion in total funds raised. However, amidst the chaos, there are some teams are keeping focused and designing protocols that will fundamentally transform how value is generated, tracked, and transferred in the 21st century.

So how can we make sure that the teams being funded amidst the ICO hype are those building the future and not those building their bank accounts?

First, although there are some obvious reasons, let's answer the question of why we should care.

## A Market For Lemons

While it might sound satisfying to some to say that, even if it's funding low-quality projects more often than not, the market is working as intended we view this as fundamentally misguided. Not only is the current system incredibly inefficient from a capital allocation perspective, it poses an existential risk to any blockchain that allows for token ecosystems. As outlined in George Akerlof's famous paper "The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism" the presence of inferior goods along with a few other conditions will eventually drive a market out of existence. The four core criteria for a lemon market are as follows:

1) An asymmetry of information;

2) An incentive for sellers to pass off low-quality products as high quality;

3) A continuum of seller qualities exist; and

4) No recourse for purchases of low-quality products.

While we believe it is easy to see that ICO markets satisfy these criteria, [this article](https://medium.com/@avtarsehra/icos-and-economics-of-lemon-markets-96638e86b3b2) by Avtar Sehra does a much better job of explaining the similarities between ICOs and lemons.

In addition, even in cases where ICO offerings are made in good faith, with real potential for quality, the instant liquidity provided by most token offerings can actually distract from building the underlying protocol or application. In fact, this is precisely why [companies that raise too much money too quickly](https://www.fastcompany.com/3057027/the-case-against-startups-raising-as-much-money-as-humanly-possible) are more likely to fail.

If we really want to ensure that valuable projects in the ecosystem continue to get funding then, we need better mechanisms to ensure funds go to the right teams.

## The Current State of ICO Due Diligence

The ecosystem around ICOs has evolved significantly over the past two years, with an ever increasing list of ICO news and research outlets emerging. But at its core the current process for evaluating ICOs typically involves looking at the same three metrics any early-stage investor looks at: team, product, and market.

### Team

>I don’t know what a business is. All a company is is a bunch of people together to create a product or service. There’s no such thing as a business, just pursuit of a goal—a group of people pursuing a goal.
~Elon Musk

Team is the only metric that can be directly assessed at any stage of a company’s life. It’s hard to know much about a product that hasn’t been built or a market that hasn’t been explored, but before there’s anything there’s a team. In some cases VCs will almost entirely ignore product and market on the assumption that a good team with neither will solve the problem while a bad team with both will squander the opportunity.

The importance of teams isn’t to say that founders need to be a group of MIT graduates with 10 years or more of experience in the domain they’re exploring because [even they can forget to change their passwords](https://www.wired.com/story/enigma-ico-ethereum-heist/). However, a good team should always display passion, integrity, and adaptability. Most of these are tired and often nebulous concepts, but they define what you’ll hear from almost any established early-stage VC and (consequently) what you’ll read in almost any ICO report today.

### Product

>I don't have a quote for here, and whether I should have included quotes in the other two sections is frankly in question.
>~Me


If we agree with Elon’s description above we agree that every company starts with a team and an idea or goal, but they don’t always (or often) start with a product. Of course, as any bad motivational poster will tell you, building a product is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. And as anyone who’s managed a project before knows, there’s a long road between starting a project and actually building out its core features. As might be expected that road starts with planning out what those core features are, breaking them down into manageable milestones, prioritizing, and planning resources accordingly.

Naturally then, the first step in evaluating a product is to ask the question: does the team have a product? If they do, great, you can evaluate the product on its merits. If they don’t (like many projects in the blockchain ecosystem), the question really comes back to whether or not the team has a clearly defined vision and the ability to execute on that vision. In the ICO world determining this is still done in a relatively information fashion, through reading whitepapers, and talking with founders.

### Market

>In a great market — a market with lots of real potential customers — the market pulls product out of the startup.
~Marc Andreesen

While every company has to have a team, and is at working on building or selling something that at least vaguely resembles a product or service, not every company has to have a market. In fact, plenty of companies throughout history haven’t had any market at all. Those companies don’t exist anymore.

The fundamental importance of market in the discussion of product-market fit has led some like Andy Rachleff, formerly of Benchmark Capital, to the conclusion that market is actually the most important thing to look for in a startup. ‘Rachleff’s Law’ as he calls it (like many VCs Andy was known for his humility) is as follows:

- When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins.
- When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins.
- When a great team meets a great market, something special happens.

In short what Andy was trying to get at is that neither a good team or a 'good' product will fix having no market for what you're offering. Listening to customers and letting the market's needs drive your product is critical, and organizations that have opted not to get feedback from the market are setting themselves up for failure.

### Crypto-Specific Considerations

There are also a few other metrics that have to be considered in light of the fact that blockchain investments are often investments in tokens that power protocols and applications. Some of these questions are as follows:

**1) What does the token do?**

This might be hard for some to hear but not everything needs to be a token. However, with the current hype around ICOs everything is becoming one. Understanding what a token does and why those functions can’t be managed by an existing token (most often ETH given that most ICOs are ERC20 tokens) is critical.

**2) What are the token economics?**

Examples of good token economics.

## Traditional Funding methods


## Fixing The Market

So clearly there are some very simple core questions we can ask about blockchain projects to get a general idea of whether they make sense as an investment. But in a space with this much hype, and where so much is on the line if bad projects get funded, we believe more is required. In particular we believe that:

a) More accessible, real-time data is needed to help investors or contributors to make sound decisions about where to put their money; and

b) A way outside of founder promises is required to ensure that vesting schedules are adhered to and are predicated on tangible milestones.

These are problems we think GitToken can help solve by tying code - which we believe makes up the majority of the work in building new protocols and applications - to token issuance. Let's address them in order.

These are all good questions to ask, but what if we could compare traditional early-stage metrics and examine token economics all at once?

## Proof of code: Using GitToken to Tie Cash to Contributions

GitToken allows any project to show its commitment to code by tying its fundraising to specific GitHub events and milestones. Projects using GitToken can assure contributors that their donations are being put directly towards tangible roadmap items without any middleman allocating the funds. Moreover, GitToken allows project owners to better manage their projects and incentivize their teams to put in the effort required to make the project a success.
